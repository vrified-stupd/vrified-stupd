My name is Theo, and I code stuff I guess.

Email: vrified.stupd@gmail.com (I don't check my gmail that often so don't bother)

Discord: vrifiedstupd

I'm free to chat at weekend evenings (Philippine time btw), just don't ask me for help, I'm not the right guy.

I like to code in C and Python (Yes it is a weird combo, I know) and I do some robotics sometimes. I also aspire to be a computer engineer in the future as I really like working with computer parts and knowing how they work.
